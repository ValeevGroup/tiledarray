# Basic Programming of TiledArray {#Basic-Programming}

TiledArray is a framework for computing with block-sparse tensors on shared- and distributed-memory computers. It is designed to allow users to compose tensor expressions of arbitrary complexity in native C++ code that closely resembles the standard mathematical notation. TiledArray is designed for strong scalability in real applications, with pilot benchmarks having executed on hundreds of thousands of cores.

TiledArray is built on top of the [MADNESS](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness) parallel runtime, denoted here as MADWorld. MADWorld provides a powerful task-based programming model that is key to TiledArray's scalability.

This document is intended for new users of TiledArray. It covers basic concepts, construction and initialization of tensors, composing tensor expressions, and accessing results. More advanced users are directed elsewhere in this Wiki for topics such as user-defined Tiles, etc.

**NOTE:** This guide, and TiledArray itself, is a work in progress. Therefore information may be changed or added at any time. While we strive to maintain a stable user interface, TiledArray is still evolving, sometimes in non-backward-compatible ways.

# Primer

## Concepts

### Tensor/Array
TiledArray represents tensors as ordinary (multidimensional) arrays of values (i.e. nothing specifies the transformation properties of the array data to make it a proper tensor); henceforth we will use tensor and array interchangeably. An order-_n_ tensor (i.e., a tensor with _n_ indices) is represented as an _n_-dimensional array. Tensor in TiledArray is a map from a Range of Indices (a hyperrectangular range in ℤ<sup>n</sup>) to ring ℜ. The highest-level tensor data structure in TiledArray is a distributed tiled multidimensional array, modeling concept DistArray and represented by C++ class `DistArray`. DistArray is a directly-addressable sequence of _tiles_. Tiles are distributed among all or some processes in your application, hence only a subset of tiles is _rapidly_ accessible from a given process. A DistArray is defined by a TiledRange, which specifies a cartesian tiling of the element Range, a Pmap, which maps tile index to the processor on which it resides, and a Shape, which specifies the structure of the array at the tile level (e.g. it can indicate whether a given tile is zero or not in a sparse array). TiledArray supports two variants of DistArray out of the box: _dense_, in which all tiles are assumed non-zero, and _block-sparse_, in which some tiles may be assumed to be zero, and thus omitted.

### Range
An order-_n_ Range is a hyperrectangle in ℤ<sup>n</sup>, where _n_ ≥ 0 (currently TiledArray only supports ranges in the nonnegative subset of ℤ<sup>n</sup>). Range is used to define valid values for element and tile Indices. The size of each _mode_ (side) of the hyperrectangle is its _extent_; 0-based indexing of modes is used throughout.

### Index
Index specifies a location in a range. An index may be a coordinate index or an ordinal index.

### Coordinate Index
A sequence of non-negative _n_ integers that represents an element of a Range. The first integer refers to the 0th mode of the range, etc. The following figure illustrates coordinate indices of the elements of a 4 by 4 matrix.

![Coordinate indices in a 4x4 matrix](CoordinateIndex.png)

### Ordinal Index
A single nonnegative integer value specifying the position of an element in a totally-ordered Range. Row-major lexicographical order is used by most classes in TiledArray. The following figure illustrates (row-major) ordinal indices of the elements of a 4 by 4 matrix.

![Ordinal indices in a 4x4 matrix](OrdinalIndex.png)

### TiledRange
TiledRange is a Range each mode of which is _tiled_, i.e. divided into contiguous, non-overlaping blocks; cartesian product of mode tilings defines the overall tiling of the range into subranges; each such subrange 
 is a tile of the TiledRange. Tiles in a TiledRange are indexed just like the elements of the underlying range, hence the notions of _element range_ and _tile range_ arise in discussing TiledRange .

### Tile
Tile of an array is any hyperrectangular sub-block of the array; a Tile is an array of same order as the base array. Division of DistArray into tiles is defined by its TiledRange. Tiles are local objects, i.e. only the process on which the tile resides has access to its data. Tile is defined by its Range.

### Dense Array
A dense array is an array where all tiles are explicitly stored. All tiles of a dense array are non-zero tiles.

![Dense 4x4 matrix](DenseArray.png)

### Block-Sparse Array
In a block-spare array, only non-zero blocks are stored. For example, the array pictured below contains four non-zero blocks (shown in green). You may specify any block in an array to be a zero tile or non-zero tile. For example, a 2D, block-sparse array may look like:

![Block-sparse 4x4 matrix](BlockSparseArray.png)

where zero tiles are shown in white, while non-zero tiles are shown in green.

### Non-Zero and Zero Tiles
A non-zero tile is a sub-block of a DistArray that explicitly stores all elements for that tile. A zero tile is a sub-block of a DistArray that implicitly contains all zero elements, but is never stored. where all elements are equal to zero (Note: The data for zero tiles is not explicitly stored).

![Zero and non-zero in a block-sparse 4x4 matrix](ZeroArray.png)

### Owner
The owner of a tile is the process which stores that tile.

### Pmap
A process map that defines ownership of each tile.

### Shape
An object that specifies the structure of DistArray. E.g. it could be represented by a bitset where a set bit represents a non-zero tile and an unset bit represents zero tiles in a DistArray.

## Implementation

TiledArray is a library written in standard C++ using features available in the 2017 ISO standard (commonly known as C++17). To use TiledArray it is necessary to `#include` header `tiledarray.h`. imports most TiledArray features into namespace `TiledArray`. For convenience, namespace alias `TA` is also provided. Although the alias can be disabled by defining the `TILEDARRAY_DISABLE_NAMESPACE_TA` preprocessor variable, all examples will assume that the `TA` alias is not disabled.

P.S. It sometimes may be possible to reduce source code couplings by importing only _forwarding_ declarations. This is done by `#include`ing header `tiledarray_fwd.h`.

## Parallel Runtime
TiledArray exposes several features of the MADWorld programming model, most importantly
*worlds*, *tasks*, and *futures*.

A world, represented by an object of `TA::World` class (which is currently just an alias to `madness::World`),
represents a collection of MPI processes.
World is an extension of the MPI (intra)communicator concept that provides not only a communication context
but also an execution context (such as task queue, etc.). Each array in TiledArray
lives in a specific world (the default world, just like `MPI_COMM_WORLD`, spans the entire set of processes which called `MPI_Init_thread`).

Task is a unit of execution in MADWorld. Most operations in TiledArray are expressed as a collection of *fine-grained* tasks scheduled by the MADWorld; the fine-grained nature of tasks allows to express much more parallelism than is possible with traditional approaches like fork-join. Task parallel runtime of MADWorld also allows to overlap task execution (computation) with data movement (communication), and thus tolerate better all sources of latency.

When submitting a task to the task queue, a `madness::Future` object is returned, which is a placeholder for the result of a task. Futures may also be given to other tasks as input. In this way, futures are used to define task dependencies; they can be thought as nodes of the graph of tasks representing the computation. Note that MADWorld futures are similar to `std::future` (or, rather, `std::shared_future`) in standard C++, the main distinction is that `madness::Future` is *global* (i.e. a Future on one process can refer to a result produced on another) and it is possible to *attach continuations* to `madness::Future`.

# Using TiledArray

A typical scenario for using TiledArray will perform the following steps:
* Initialize the parallel runtime environment
* Construct `DistArray` objects
* Initialize tile data of the arrays
* Implement algebraic tensor expressions
Let's walk through each step in detail.

## Initializing the Parallel Runtime Environment

To use TiledArray it is necessary to first initialize its runtime environment, such as [MADNESS](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness) and its dependents, CUDA, etc:
```.cpp
#include <tiledarray.h> // imports most TiledArray features

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // Initialize TiledArray
  auto& world = TA::initialize(argc, argv);

  // Do some work here.

  TA::finalize();
  return 0;
}
```
`TA::initialize` initializes the TiledArray runtime and returns a reference to the default World object, which by default spans all MPI processes. `TA::finalize` shuts down the TiledArray runtime; after this it is no longer possible to use TiledArray, so this is typically done at the very end of the program. It is *not possible* to call `TA::initialize` *more than once* in your program.

Since TiledArray depends on MPI (via MADWorld), `TA::initialize` first checks if MPI had been initialized. If MPI is not yet initialized `TA::initialize` will do so by calling [`MPI_Init_thread`](https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/man3/MPI_Init_thread.3.php). If MPI had already been initialized, then `TA::initialize` will only check that MPI initialization requested proper level of thread safety (serialized or full).

It is easy to initialize TiledArray on a subset of MPI processes by passing the corresponding MPI communicator to `TA::initialize`:
```.cpp
#include <tiledarray.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // Initialize MPI
  int thread_level_provided;
  MPI_Init_thread(&argc, &argv, MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, &thread_level_provided);
  assert(MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE == thread_level_provided);

  // create a communicator spanning even ranks only
  int me;  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &me);
  MPI_Comm comm_evens; MPI_Comm_split(MPI_COMM_WORLD, (me % 2 ? MPI_UNDEFINED : 0), 0, &comm_evens);

  // Initialize TiledArray on even ranks only
  if (comm_evens != MPI_COMM_NULL) {
    auto& world = TA::initialize(argc, argv, comm_evens);

    // Do some work here.

    // Finalize TiledArray
    TA::finalize();
  }

  // must finalize MPI since we initialized it ourselves
  MPI_Finalize();

  return 0;
}
```
In complex initialization scenarios it is convenient to be able to introspect whether TiledArray has been initialized and/or finalized. Use `TA::initialized()` and  `TA::finalized()` to query whether TiledArray is currently initialized and it it has been finalized, respectively.

To make initialization of TiledArray easier in presence of exceptions (e.g., within a `try` block) or multiple return statements use macro `TA_SCOPED_INITIALIZE(argc,argv,...)` instead of calling `TA::{initialize,finalize}` explicitly:
```.cpp
#include <tiledarray.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  assert(!TA::initialized());
  assert(!TA::finalized());
  
  try {
    // Initializes TiledArray
    auto& world = TA_SCOPED_INITIALIZE(argc, argv);

    // Do some work here.
    
    assert(TA::initialized());
    assert(!TA::finalized());
  }  // TA::finalize() called when leaving this scope
  // exceptional return
  catch (...) {
    assert(!TA::initialized());
    assert(TA::finalized());
    std::cerr << "oops!\n";
    return 1;
  }

  // normal return
  assert(!TA::initialized());
  assert(TA::finalized());
  return 0;
}
```

## Construct an array
To construct a `DistArray` object, you must supply following the meta data:
* [TiledRange](#construct-tiledrange-object)
* (optional) [Pmap](#construct-a-process-map-object)
* (block-sparse only) [Shape](#construct-shape-object)

### Construct TiledRange object
A TiledRange is defined by tensor/Cartesian product of tilings for each mode. Tiling for 1 mode is represented by class `TA::TiledRange1` which is most easily constructed by specifying tile boundaries as an array of indices. For example, the following code defines 2 tilings for interval [0,10), both consisting of 3 tiles:
```.cpp
TA::TiledRange1 TR0{0,3,8,10};
TA::TiledRange1 TR1{0,4,7,10};
```
The size of tiles in `TR0` are 3, 5, and 2, whereas `TR1`'s tiles has sizes 4, 3, and 3. Combining these tilings produces an order-2 `TiledRange`,
```.cpp
TA::TiledRange TR{TR0,TR1};
```
with 3 tiles in each mode, for a total of `10 x 10` (or 100) elements partitioned into 9 tiles, as pictured below:

[[images/tiledrange.png|height=250px]]

`TR` can be constructed directly without defining `TiledRange1` objects first as follows:
```.cpp
TA::TiledRange TR{{0,3,8,10},
                  {0,4,7,10}};
```
 
The TiledRange constructor in the above example is useful for simple examples and prototyping code. However, in production code it will be likely necessary to construct `TiledRange` objects with an iterator list of `TiledRange1` objects, e.g.:
```.cpp
// Construct tile boundary vector
std::vector<std::size_t> tile_boundaries;
for(std::size_t i = 0; i <= 16; i += 4)
  tile_boundaries.push_back(i);

// Construct a set of 1D TiledRanges
std::vector<TA::TiledRange1>
    ranges(2, TA::TiledRange1(tile_boundaries.begin(), tile_boundaries.end()));

// Construct the 2D TiledRange
TA::TiledRange trange(ranges.begin(), ranges.end());
```
where `tile_boundaries` defines the boundaries of tiles along a single dimension, `ranges` is the set of tile boundaries (one per dimension), and `trange` is the tiled range object that is used to construct `DistArray` objects.

### Construct a Process Map Object
A process map is used to determine owner of a given tile with requiring communication between processes. Process maps also maintain a list of local tiles (tiles owned by the current process). TiledArray provides several different types process maps that can be used to initialize `DistArray` objects. The process maps provided by TiledArray are blocked, block-cyclic, hashed, and replicated. With the exception of the replicated process map (which always returns the current process as the owner) a process map will always return the same owner for a given tile on any process. You may also create a custom process map class that is derived from `TA::Pmap`.

**Note**: You are not required to explicitly construct a process map for a `DistArray` object as the `DistArray` object will construct one for you if none is provided. You may want to construct a process map yourself if you require a particular data layout. Process maps can also be used aid in the distribution of work among processes before your array object is constructed (this may be useful when constructing sparse shapes).

To construct a process map using one of the process map provided by TiledArray:
```.cpp
const std::size_t m = 20;
const std::size_t n = 10;

std::shared_ptr<TA::Pmap>
    blocked_pmap(new TA::detail::BlockedPmap(world, m * n));

// {4,4} = # of processor rows/columns in 2d grid ... hardwired here, but should be determined programmatically
std::shared_ptr<TA::Pmap>
    cyclic_pmap(new TA::detail::CyclicPmap(world, m, n, 4, 4));

std::shared_ptr<TA::Pmap>
    hash_pmap(new TA::detail::HashPmap(world, m * n));
```
An program is provided by TiledArray in examples/pmap_test/ that demonstrates the tile distribution that is generated by the various process map objects. You can vary the output of this program by changing the number of MPI processes when running the test program. For example, the output for 16 MPI processes looks like:
```
$ mpirun -n 16 pmap

### Construct Shape Object

TiledArray supports two types of arrays: dense and sparse. If you are using dense arrays then you do not need to provide a shape object when constructing your arrays. However, to use block-sparse arrays you must use the sparse variant of the `TA::DistArray` class; you will also need to provide a `TA::SparseShape` object to its constructor. Note: although it is possible to use user-defined Shape classes, here we only discuss the stadnard `TA::SparseShape` class provided as a standard component of TiledArray.

A `TA::SparseShape` can be thought of as a dense (local) array whose elements are the Frobenius norm values for each tile. Hence the extents of the shape object are simply the extents of the tile range of the TiledRange object. Frobenius norm is chosen since its submultiplicative character makes it possible to bound the norms of tensor products; this is essential to be able to predict the shape of the result of a tensor expression.

There are two methods for constructing shape objects: distributed and replicated. You want to use distributed construction when computation of shape norms is expensive. When using distributed construction, contributions to the shape are reduced over all processes (via an all-reduce algorithm). Conversely, you want to use replicated construction when computing tile norms is inexpensive and takes less time than sharing the shape data.

The steps required to initialize a sparse shape are:

1. Set the zero tile threshold
2. Construct a [TiledRange](TiledRange) object
3. Construct a [process map](Construct a process map) (optional)

#### Zero-Tile Threshold

The zero-tile threshold is used to determine whether a tile zero or non-zero. A tile is considered to be zero if the 2-norm of the tile divided by the number of elements in the tile is less than the given threshold. That is:
```.cpp
tile.norm() / tile.range().volume() < TA::SparseShape::threshold()
```
To set the zero-tile threshold call:
```.cpp
TA::SparseShape::threshold(my_threshold);
```
where `my_threshold` is the zero threshold you specify for your application. This threshold is a global value and is used for all `SparseShape` objects. Because the zero-tile threshold is shared by all shapes, it is recommended that you set this value only once at the beginning of your program. If you change the threshold during the execution of your application, it affect all subsequent zero-tile checks but it will not change shape data. You are responsible for ensuring that changes the the threshold value during execution do not adversely affect your application.

#### Distributed SparseShape Construction

With distributed SparseShape construction, the shape data is _partially_ initialized in each process. With this method, only set tile norms for **local** tiles, otherwise the norm data stored in shape will be artificially inflated.

The advantage of this method is that computation of tile norms is distributed among all processes, but requires communication between processes. Distributed construction is preferred when the cost of recomputing tile norms on all processes is too high or impractical. The tile norms are shared among processes by the `TA::SparseShape` constructor via an all-reduce summation.

With distributed construction, it is convenient to use a process map to help partition the work load. The process map can then be used to construct `TA::DistArray` objects.
```.cpp
// User provided tile factory function.
Tensor<double> make_tile(const TA::Range& range);

// ...

// tile norms are provided as a dense tensor of floats
TA::Tensor<float> tile_norms(trange.tile_range());
for(std::size_t i = 0; i < tile_norms.volume(); ++i) {
  if(pmap->is_local(i)) {
    Tensor<double> tile = make_tile(trange.make_tile_range(i));

    tile_norm[i] = tile.norm();
  
    // ...

  } else {
    tile_norms[i] = 0;
  }
}
```
Then construct the `TA::SparseShape` object with the tile norm and tiled range. 
```
TA::SparseShape<float> shape(world, tile_norms, trange);
```
Note that in the above example we loop over every possible local tile and compute it's norm.
For mostly sparse arrays it is necessary to loop over the nonzero tiles only. The following example
demonstrates how to do this for a matrix with nonzero blocks on the diagonal only.
```.cpp
// tile norms will be provided as a sequence of nonzero elements
std::vector<std::pair<std::array<size_t,2>,float>> tile_norms;
// n = the number of tiles in each dimension of the matrix
for(std::size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
  const auto ii = i * n + i;  // the tile ordinal index
  if(pmap->is_local(ii)) {
    // compute_tile_norm({i,i}) returns the norm estimate of tile {i,i}
    tile_norm.push_back(std::make_pair(std::array<size_t,2>{i,i},compute_tile_norm({i,i})));
  }
}
TA::SparseShape<float> shape(world, tile_norms, trange);
```

#### Replicated SparseShape Construction

With replicated SparseShape construction, the shape data is fully initialized in all processes. It is important that the shape data be identical on all processes, otherwise your application will not function correctly (most likely it will deadlock).

The advantage of this method is that it does not require communication between process, but computation of tile norms for all tiles must be done on all nodes. This method is preferred when the cost of recomputation of tile norms is less than cost of communication used in distributed shape construction.

First, create a `TA::Tensor<float>` object that contains the 2-norm (or [Frobenius Norm](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html)) of each tile. 
```.cpp
// User provided tile factory function.
Tensor<double> make_tile(const TA::Range& range);

// ...

TA::Tensor<float> tile_norms(trange.tiles_range());
for(std::size_t i = 0; i < tile_norms.volume(); ++i) {
  Tensor<double> tile = make_tile(trange.make_tile_range(i));

  tile_norm[i] = tile.norm();
  
  // ...
}
```
Then construct the `TA::SparseShape` object with the tile norm and tiled range. 
```
TA::SparseShape<float> shape(tile_norms, trange);
```

### Construct a DistArray
Once you have a TiledRange and optionally shape and process map constructed, you are ready to construct a DistArray object. `TA::DistArray` class is parametrized by 2 types:
* `Tile` -- an Array type used to represent tiles of the DistArray object.
* `Policy` -- a policy type that configures the behavior of DistArray; this includes whether DistArray is dense or block-sparse, which Range and TiledRange types are used, etc.

The ability to parametrize `TA::DistArray` is essential for many advanced applications: for example, the ability to customize tiles makes it possible to compute with arrays whose tiles are generated lazily (on-the-fly), support computing on heterogeneous platforms and/or with disk/NVRAM-based tile storage, utilize compressed tile formats, use multiprecision representations, etc. Similarly, by customizing Policy it is possible to implement more general sparsity types than illustrated in this guide. However, user-defined Tiles and Policies is a more advanced topic that will be covered elsewhere; here we will focus on the two most common cases that are supported out-of-the-box: dense and block-sparse DistArray with dense CPU-only tiles over integers, reals, and complex numbers. To make using such DistArrays easier TiledArray defines the following type aliases:
* `TA::TArray<Ring>`: dense DistArray over ring type `Ring` (alias for `TA::DistArray<TA::Tensor<Ring>,TA::DensePolicy>`)
* `TA::TArrayD`: dense DistArray over `double` (alias for `TA::TArray<double>`)
* `TA::TArrayF`: dense DistArray over `float`
* `TA::TArrayZ`: dense DistArray over `std::complex<double>`
* `TA::TArrayC`: dense DistArray over `std::complex<float>`
* `TA::TArrayI`: dense DistArray over `int`
* `TA::TArrayL`: dense DistArray over `long`
* `TA::TSpArray<Ring>`: block-sparse DistArray over ring type `Ring` (alias for `TA::DistArray<TA::Tensor<Ring>,TA::SparsePolicy>`)
* `TA::TSpArrayD`: block-sparse DistArray over `double` (alias for `TA::TSpArray<double>`)
* `TA::TSpArrayF`: block-sparse DistArray over `float`
* `TA::TSpArrayZ`: block-sparse DistArray over `std::complex<double>`
* `TA::TSpArrayC`: block-sparse DistArray over `std::complex<float>`
* `TA::TSpArrayI`: block-sparse DistArray over `int`
* `TA::TSpArrayL`: block-sparse DistArray over `long`

Throughout the rest of the guide we will use these aliases instead of using more verbose `TA::DistArray` type (note, however, that when debugging your code that uses these aliases most debuggers will show the name of the full type rather than the alias names).

This example demonstrates how to construct dense and sparse DistArrays:
```.cpp
// Construct a dense DistArray (of doubles) with the default process map
TA::TArrayD a1(world, trange);

// Construct a dense DistArray with a user specified process map
TA::TArrayD a2(world, trange, pmap);

// Construct a sparse DistArray with the default process map
TA::TSpArrayD a3(world, trange, shape);

// Construct a sparse DistArray with a user specified process map
TA::TSpArrayD a4(world, trange, shape, pmap);
```

Recall that `DistArray` objects have their data _distributed_ across the entire World in which they are constructed. To ensure a consistent state their constructor is a _collective_ operation, i.e. it must be invoked  on every processor with the same arguments.

## Initializing Tiles 

There are several methods available to initialize array tiles. Users can initialize tiles by calling a `Array::set` with index and
* a tile object,
* a future to a tile object,
* an iterator tile data, or
* a constant to fill the tile.
The preferred method is to construct tiles via MADNESS tasks and provide a `madness::Future` for the tile (see example below).

### Explicit Tile Initialization
The easiest method to initialize a DistArray is to loop over local tiles and explicitly initialize each tile. This method distributes initialization work over all processes in the World. Here's the example:
```.cpp
// Construct a dense array
TA::TArrayD array(world...);
// Initialize local tiles
for(TArrayD::iterator it = array.begin(); it != array.end(); ++it) {
  // Construct a tile
  TArrayD::value_type tile(array.trange().make_tile_range(it.index()));

  // Fill tile with data
  for(std::size_t i = 0; i < tile.size(); ++i)
    tile[i] = 0.0;

  // Insert the tile into the array
  *it = tile;
}
```
The outer loop in this example iterates over the local tiles of `array`. Within the loop body we first create an tile (an object of `TArrayD::value_type` type, which in this case is `TA::Tensor<double>`). Then we loop over its elements and assign each to zero.

N.B. Of course, filling a DistArray with a constant is such a common use case that there's already a method for exactly that: `array.fill(0.0)`.

There are more serious issues with the last example. First, it is too verbose. Second, it's not generic enough (i.e. trying to reuse it for a sparse DistArray would require changing a few lines). Both issues can be solved by using modern C++ features:
```.cpp
// Initialize local tiles
for(auto it = begin(array); it != end(array); ++it) {
  // Construct a tile
  auto tile = decltype(array)::value_type(array.trange().make_tile_range(it.index()));

  // Fill tile with data
  std::fill(tile.begin(), tile.end(), 0.0);

  // Insert the tile into the array
  *it = tile;
}
```
The new code is better in a few ways:
* explicit use of `array`'s type is eliminated thanks to `auto` and `decltype` (caveat: type deduction can make it more difficult to diagnose compilation errors or introduce unwanted conversions), and
* the inner loop has been replaced by a more efficient and cleaner `std::fill` (N.B. any modern compiler at the max optimization level will replace `std::fill` with call to `memset` when appropriate, so this is the fastest way to fill the tile).

You can also initialize tile elements using a coordinate index instead of an ordinal index. The following example is equivalent to the previous example, except the tile elements are accessed via a coordinate index.
```.cpp
// Add local tiles
for(auto it = begin(array); it != end(array); ++it) {
  // Construct a tile
  auto tile = decltype(array)::value_type(array.trange().make_tile_range(it.index()));

  // Store a reference to the start and finish array of the tile
  const auto& lobound = tile.range().lobound();
  const auto& upbound = tile.range().upbound();

  // Fill tile with data
  // this explicitly assumes order-4 tensors!
  std::size_t i[] = {0,0,0,0};  // instead of fundamental array could use std::array, std::vector, or any SequenceContainer
  for(i[0] = lobound[0]; i[0] != upbound[0]; ++i[0])
    for(i[1] = lobound[1]; i[1] != upbound[1]; ++i[1])
      for(i[2] = lobound[2]; i[2] != upbound[2]; ++i[2])
        for(i[3] = lobound[3]; i[3] != upbound[3]; ++i[3])
          tile[i] = 0.0;

  // Insert the tile into the array
  *it = tile;
}
```

Note that in the examples shown so far tile initialization is parallelized over MPI processes only; on each process _only_ the main thread does the initialization work. To parallelize over threads on each process we can
also initialize tiles by submitting within MADNESS tasks. To do this we need to define a task function that will generate tiles. For example:
```.cpp
auto make_tile(const TA::Range& range) {
  // Construct a tile
  TA::TArrayD::value_type tile(range);

  // Fill tile with data
  std::fill(tile.begin(), tile.end(), 0.0);

  return tile;
}
```
Using `make_tile()`, the first example can be rewritten to generate tiles in parallel.
```.cpp
// Add local tiles
for(auto it = begin(array); it != end(array); ++it) {
  // Construct a tile using a MADNESS task.
  auto tile = world.taskq.add(& make_tile, array.trange().make_tile_range(it.index()));

  // Insert the tile into the array
  *it = tile;
}
```
Pushing off the initialization work to MADNESS tasks makes initialization asynchronous,
i.e. actual initialization work will happen after task creation. However,
in general there is no need to wait for the initialization work to complete:
it is completely safe to use `array` in TiledArray expressions even though its initialization
may not be complete yet. `DistArray` was designed for such
asynchronous execution from the ground up.

### Optimized Tile Initialization

In the above example, we generated one task per tile. However, there is a small overhead associated with generating and running a task. If the tiles are very small and/or the time required to initialize a tile is very small, then the overhead from creating and running tasks may cause your application to run slower in parallel than serially. To alleviate this problem we need to create tasks that initialize several tiles at once.

The example below, does this by recursively dividing an iterator range in half until the number of elements in the range is less than or equal to `block_size`. Once the size of the iterator range is small enough, the task will initialize the tiles in the iterator subrange. You do not want to make block size too small or too big, but it is usually fairly easy to achieve optimal performance.

```.cpp
// Construct a tile filled with zeros
template <typename Iterator>
void make_tile(
    TA::TArrayD& array,
    Iterator first,
    Iterator last,
    const std::size_t block_size)
{
  //Make tasks that generate more than one tile.
  std::size_t size = std::distance(first, last);
  while(size > block_size) {
    // Divide the iterator range in half, middle = (last - first)/2
    Iterator middle = first;
    size /= 2;
    std::advance(middle, size);

    // Construct a task to evaluate middle to last
    make_tile_task(array, middle, last, block_size);

    // This task will now evaluate first to middle
    last = middle;
  }// This loop uses tasks to generates tasks.
  // once the size is small enough then use the current task to assign tiles.

  // Assign portion of array
  for(; first != last; ++first) {

    // Construct tile
    auto tile = TA::TArrayD::value_type(array.trange().make_tile_range(first.index()));

    // Fill tile with your data, here it is 0's
    std::fill(tile.begin(), tile.end(), 0.0);

    // Add the tile to the array
    *first = tile;
  }
}

template <typename Iterator>
void make_tile_task(TA::TArrayD &array, Iterator first, Iterator last, const std::size_t block_size){
  //Generate a madness task to make tile.  This assumes you defined the trange for array elsewhere.
  array.world().taskq.add(& make_tile<Iterator>, array, first, last, block_size);
}

void make_array(TA::TArrayD &array, std::size_t block_size) {
  make_tile_task(array, begin(array), end(array), block_size);
}
```
`make_array` is the top-level function that initializes an array:
```.cpp
make_array(array, 2);  // each task will initialize up to 2 tiles
```

# Complete Example Program
This example shows a complete program that constructs arrays in parallel and performs a tensor contraction.
```.cpp
#include <tiledarray.h>

// Construct a TA::Tensor<T> filled with v
template <typename T>
TA::Tensor<T> make_tile(const TA::Range& range, const double v) {
  // Allocate a tile
  TA::Tensor<T> tile(range);
  std::fill(tile.begin(), tile.end(), v);

  return tile;
}

// Fill array x with value v
void init_array(TA::TArrayD& x, const double v) {
  // Add local tiles to a
  for(auto it = begin(x); it != end(x); ++it) {
    // Construct a tile using a MADNESS task.
    auto tile = x.world().taskq.add(make_tile<double>, x.trange().make_tile_range(it.index()), v);

    // Insert the tile into the array
    *it = tile;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // Initialize runtime
  auto& world = TA::initialize(argc, argv);

  // Construct tile boundary vector
  std::vector<std::size_t> tile_boundaries;
  for(std::size_t i = 0; i <= 16; i += 4)
    tile_boundaries.push_back(i);

  // Construct a set of TiledRange1's
  std::vector<TA::TiledRange1>
    ranges(2, TA::TiledRange1(tile_boundaries.begin(), tile_boundaries.end()));

  // Construct the 2D TiledRange
  TA::TiledRange trange(ranges.begin(), ranges.end());

  // Construct array objects.
  TA::TArrayD a(world, trange);
  TA::TArrayD b(world, trange);
  TA::TArrayD c(world, trange);

  // Initialize a and b.
  init_array(a, 3.0);
  init_array(b, 2.0);

  // Print the content of input tensors, a and b.
  std::cout << "a = \n" << a << "\n";
  std::cout << "b = \n" << b << "\n";

  // Compute the contraction c(m,n) = sum_k a(m,k) * b(k,n)
  c("m,n") = a("m,k") * b("k,n");

  // Print the result tensor, c.
  std::cout << "c = \n" << c << "\n";

  TA::finalize();
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the tasks that initialize `a` and `b` will execute during and
after the corresponding `init_array` statements; in fact initialization of `a`
and `b` can overlap.. If your initialization work needs to be performed in
particular sequence you may need to add `world.gop.fence()` to ensure that all
preceding work in the particular world has finished.

### Constructing Replicated Arrays

There are two methods for generating replicated Arrays. The first method distributes computation, where data for each tile is generated on one node and distributed to all other nodes. The communication cost for this method is `O(n(n-1))`. This type of construction is appropriate when the data is small but expensive to compute.

The second method is replicated computation, where the data for each tile is generated on all nodes. Since the data is generated on all nodes, there is no communication with this method. Replicated computation is appropriate for data that is inexpensive to compute and/or the communcation cost in the first method is greater than the computation time.

If you want to use a hybrid approach, where each tile is computed on a small subset of nodes and distributed to the remaining, you should construct a replicated Array and write your own algorithm to computing and distributing data.

#### Distributed Computation

The procedure for constructing a replicated array with distributed computation is the same as constructing other replicated arrays, except `Array::make_replicated()` is called after the local tiles have been inserted into the array.
```.cpp
// Construct a distributed array.
TA::TArrayD array(world, trange);

// Add local tiles
for(auto it = begin(array); it != end(array); ++it) {
  // Construct a tile using a MADNESS task.
  auto tile =
    world.taskq.add(& make_tile, array.trange().make_tile_range(it.index()));

  // Insert the tile into the array
  array.set(it.index(), tile);
}

// Convert the distributed array to a replicated array,
// add distribute data.
array.make_replicated();
```

#### Replicated Computation

The procedure for constructing a replicated array with replicated computation is similar to the distributed computation method, except the array is constructed with a replicated process map (pmap).
```.cpp
// Construct a replicated array.
auto replicated_pmap = std::make_shared<TA::detail::ReplicatedPmap>(world, trange.tiles_range().volume());
TA::TArrayD array(world, trange, replicated_pmap);

// Add all tiles
for(std::size_t i = 0; i < array.size(); ++i) {
  // Construct a tile using a MADNESS task.
  auto tile =
    world.taskq.add(& make_tile, array.trange().make_tile_range(i));

  // Insert the tile into the array
  array.set(i, tile);
}
```

# Tensor Expressions

Examples of tensor expressions:
```.cpp
E("i,j") = 2.0 * A("i,k") * B("k,j") + C("k,j") * D("k,i");

C("i,j") = A("i,j") + B("i,j");

B("i,j") = -A("i,j");

C("i,j") = multiply(A("i,j"), B("i,j"));

double x = A("i,j").dot(B("j,i"));

double n = A("i,j").norm2();
```
