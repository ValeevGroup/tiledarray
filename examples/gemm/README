The test programs in the dgemm directory are simple square matrix multiply tests
for TiledArray (dense, sparse, and banded matrices), Eigen, and BLAS. The
TiledArray tests are distributed memory applications and should be run with MPI.
Eigen and BLAS are serial applications (or shared memory depending on the BLAS
library you use and compile flags).

Applications usage:

  ta_dense matrix_size block_size [repetitions]

  ta_sparse matrix_size block_size sparsity [repetitions]

  ta_band matrix_size block_size band_width [repetitions]

  ta_blas matrix_size [repetitions]

  ta_eigen matrix_size [repetitions]

Argument definitions:

  * matrix_size = The number of elements in each dimension 

  * block_size = The number of elements in each block (matrix_size must be 
                 evenly divisible by block_size)

  * sparsity = The percent (1-100) of blocks that are non-zero
  
  * band_width = The number of diagonal bands from the center to the outer edge
  
  * repetitions = The number of times that the test is repeated
