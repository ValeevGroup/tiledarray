# Synopsis
TiledArray is a scalable, block-sparse tensor framework for rapid composition of high-performance tensor arithmetic, appearing for example in many-body quantum mechanics. It allows users to compose tensor expressions of arbitrary complexity in native C++ code that closely resembles the standard mathematical notation. The framework is designed to scale from a single multicore computer to a massive distributed-memory multiprocessor.

TiledArray is built on top of MADNESS parallel runtime (MADWorld), part of [MADNESS numerical calculus framework](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness).

TiledArray is a work in progress. Its development has been possible thanks to generous support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, and the Department of Energy.

# Design Goals
* General-purpose arithmetic on dense and block-sparse tensors;
* High-level (math-like) composition as well as full access to low-level data and algorithms, both from C++
* Massive shared- and distributed-memory parallelism
* Deeply-reusable framework: everything can be customized, from tile types (e.g. to support on-disk or compute-on-the-fly tensors) to how the structure of sparse tensors is described.

# Example Code

The following example expressions are written in C++ with TiledArray. TiledArray use the [Einstein summation convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) when evaluating tensor expressions.

* Matrix-matrix multiplication

   ```.cpp
   C("m,n") = 2.0 * A("m,k") * B("k,n");
   ```

* Matrix-vector multiplication

   ```.cpp
   C("n") = A("k") * B("k,n");
   ```

* A more complex tensor expression
 
   ```.cpp
   E("m,n") = 2.0 * A("m,k") * B("k,n") + C("k,n") * D("k,m");
   ```

The following application is a minimal example of a distributed-memory matrix multiplcation.

```.cpp
#include <tiledarray.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Initialize the parallel runtime
  TA::World& world = TA::initialize(argc, argv);
  
  // Construct a 2D tiled range structure that defines
  // the tiling of an array. Each dimension contains
  // 10 tiles.
    auto trange = TA::TiledRange{
      TA::TiledRange1{0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100},
      TA::TiledRange1{0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}};
  
  // Construct and fill the argument arrays with data
  TA::TArrayD A(world, trange);
  TA::TArrayD B(world, trange);
  A.fill_local(3.0);
  B.fill_local(2.0);
  
  // Construct the (empty) result array.
  TA::TArrayD C;
  
  // Perform a distributed matrix multiplication
  C("i,j") = A("i,k") * B("k,j");
  
  // Tear down the parallel runtime. 
  TA::finalize();
  return 0;
}
```

# Performance

Parallel performance of TiledArray for multiplication of dense square matrices on [Mira](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/mira), an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, compared with that of [Cyclops Tensor Framework](https://github.com/solomonik/ctf) and [ScaLAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/):

This figure was obtained with the help of an award from [the Department of Energy INCITE program](http://www.doeleadershipcomputing.org/incite-program/).

Excellent parallel scalability is also possible for much more complicated expressions than just a single GEMM, as demonstrated below for the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wave function solver. Parallel speed-up of 1 iteration of CCSD solver for uracil trimer in 6-31G* AO basis was measured on ["BlueRidge" cluster](https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.arc.vt.edu/computing/blueridge-sandy-bridge/) at Virginia Tech (wall time on one 16-core node = 1290 sec):

# Installing TiledArray

The short version: assuming that MPI compiler wrappers are in your path, and this is a platform with BLAS/LAPACK installed system-wide in a standard location:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ValeevGroup/TiledArray.git tiledarray
$ cd tiledarray
$ cmake -B build \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/tiledarray/install \
    -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/vg/toolchains/<toolchain-file-for-your-platform>.cmake \
    .
$ cmake --build build
(optional) $ cmake --build build --target check
$ cmake --build build --target install
```
Here `<toolchain-file-for-your-platform>` is the appropriate toolchain file from [the Valeev Group CMake kit](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/kit-cmake/tree/master/toolchains); an alternative is
to provide your own toolchain file. On some standard platforms (e.g. MacOS) the toolchain file can be skipped.

The detailed instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
